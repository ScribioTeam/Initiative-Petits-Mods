 rusrevolt.2.t:0 "The Tsar abdicates"
 rusrevolt.2.d:0 "The ongoing war has caused a breakdown of morale and mutiny within the army, stoked popular discontent with the autocracy and led to riots in the very heart of the Empire, which have compelled Nicholas II to abdicate the throne. Now that the monarchy has been overthrown, a Provisional Government is obliged to take charge and extract the Russian state from the dire straits she finds herself in. Meanwhile, the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers' Deputies is being formed in Petrograd, also aspiring to become the dominant power in Russia. It would be most unwise to grant them an excuse for confrontation, therefore we should either listen to their counsel, or suppress their activities."
 rusrevolt.2.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 rusrevolt.5.t:0 "Russian Revolution!"
 rusrevolt.5.d:0 "The world war has exacerbated internal issues within the Russian Empire, forcing Tsar Nicholas II Romanov to take extreme measures and abdicate the throne. The democratic opposition has formed a Provisional Government, which lacks support from the working class of the country. If the new government does not make concessions to the burgeoning strength of the Petrograd Soviet, which considers itself the sole legitimate authority, then perhaps we should prepare for an armed confrontation within Russia itself."

 rusrevolt.3.t:0 "Minister-Chairman Appointed"
 rusrevolt.3.d:0 "Prince Georgy Lvov has been appointed as head of the Provisional Government during a difficult period for the new republic. While a system of Dual Power operates within Russia, the Provisional Government must restore order to the rebellious capital, and bring the war to a triumphant conclusion."
 rusrevolt.3.a:0 "I hope he manages to lead the country out of crisis."

 rusrevolt.1.t:0 "Lvov Resigns"
 rusrevolt.1.d:0 "In view of the indecisiveness of Minister-Chairman Georgy Lvov, the decision has been taken to replace him with Alexander Kerensky, the highly popular and charismatic Minister for War and one of the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Now, Kerensky, the "Knight of the Revolution", must remedy the chaos and disorder prevalent throughout the country."
 rusrevolt.1.a:0 "Kerensky is the last hope of the Republic."
 
 rusrevolt.4_tt:0 "§RThis may provoke the Bolsheviks uprising in the near future!§\n"
 
 rusrevolt.4.t:0 "Uprising in Petrograd!"
 rusrevolt.4.d:0 "Soldiers and sailors in Petrograd demanded the immediate dismantlement of the Provisional Government, and the transfer of all power to the Soviets! The Bolsheviks, directed by their leader, Vladimir Lenin, vehemently agitated for the overthrow of the government. The uprising turned into a bloody massacre in the streets of the capital, as government forces opened fire. Kerensky’s popularity has plummeted to the point that he holds neither credability nor respect amongst the generals. The situation is worrying, as the rebellious General Lavr Kornilov has advanced his troops towards Petrograd, thus becoming yet another enemy of the embattled Republic. He threatens to establish a military dictatorship in Russia! However, the establishment of such a dictatorship would completely erase all of our successes since the overthrow of the Tsar!"

 rusrevolt.4.a:0 "We will get rid of the Bolsheviks ourselves!"
 rusrevolt.4.b:0 "Kornilov will drive out all the Bolsheviks!"
 
 rusrevolt.8.t:0 "Coup d’état in Russia!"
 rusrevolt.8.d:0 "The political situation in Russia continues to astound with its rapid changes and volatility. Today, the newly established Russian Republic was overthrown by the rebel General Lavr Kornilov. The Petrograd Soviet was dispersed by the General’s guards, and the leaders of the Bolsheviks were forced to flee to Germany in the hopes of one day returning and liberating their homeland from the Kornilov regime. The Provisional Government itself was not spared Kornilov’s wrath, and was forcefully disbanded. Minister-Chairman Alexander Kerensky managed to flee the Winter Palace shortly before the arrival of the Kornilov’s troops. Kerensky disappeared into the US embassy, before fleeing by sea to the United States together with the American embassy staff and other officials."
 rusrevolt.8.a:0 "The Russian mutiny is senseless and merciless!"
 
 rusrevolt.6.t:0 "The Storming of the Winter Palace!"
 rusrevolt.6.d:0 "The failed policies of the Provisional Government since taking power have boosted the popularity of the outlawed Bolshevik Party. Ultimately, the Petrograd Soviet, being almost completely controlled by the Bolsheviks, decided to seize power through an armed uprising. The forces of the Red Guard deprived the Provisional Government of vital access to communications such as printing presses and telegraph offices in the capital. Government supporters were swept aside and control of strategically important facilities in Petrograd was wrested from them. The last bastion of the Provisional Government is their residence: the Winter Palace in the heart of the city. A second revolution now seems inevitable, with the population tensely awaiting the signal that will set off the storming of the palace.\nThen, from the deck of the cruiser «Aurora», a blank shot is fired..."
 rusrevolt.6.a:0 "Defend the Winter Palace!"

 rusrevolt.7.t:0 "The Great Socialist Revolution!"
 rusrevolt.7.d:0 "Another uprising took place in Russia last night. The Bolsheviks took the offensive and seized the seat of the Provisional Government: the Winter Palace. All remaining ministers were arrested, and the palace’s defenders voluntarily surrendered to the Soviet. The flames of socialist revolution spread like wildfire throughout Russia, causing shockwaves that reverberate across the entire world. However, the scattered forces of the Provisional Government and other groups are ready to repulse the Soviets, with whom they have fundamental disagreements. Perhaps, if Vladimir Lenin succeeds in defeating his opponents, we can begin to contemplate world revolution?"
 rusrevolt.7.a:0 "The Revolution from which the world shook."
 rusrevolt.7.b:0 "The Revolution triumphant!"
 
 
 rusrevolt.ukr.1.d:0 "The Central Rada of Ukraine received an ultimatum from the Soviet government. They demand to leave their neutral position in the Civil War, they call us accomplices of the counter-revolution! We are going through hard times, and we also have a war inside the country, and Ukrainian communists and anarchists are also pushing hard on the government. If it comes to Russia's intervention, then the country will be in chaos ..."

 rusrevolt.ukr.pol.d.t:0 "The Ukrainian Rada asks us for help. They need support in the fight against the Soviet government, which also threatens us.

 rusrevolt.pol.1.d:0 "Poland was the last bastion between Europe and the Soviet Revolution.

 SOV.tsar.2.t:0 "Nicholas II died!"
 SOV.tsar.2.d:0 "The illegal Soviet government gave the order to kill our Tsar, Nicholas II. Together with him were shot his son, the direct heir of the imperial throne, and his entire family. Russia has lost in his person the last hope to revive the empire, but the relatives of the royal family of Romanovs who fled abroad and crossed over to our side are ready to support us in the fight against the bloody regime of the Communists! The Romanov family will not perish in time!"
 SOV.tsar.2.a:0 "They died for Russia ..."
 
 SOV.tsar.3.t:0 "Return of Nicholas II"
 SOV.tsar.3.d:0 "Our Tsar-father returned from exile! Having spent several months in confinement with his family, Nicholas II is struggling to keep his feet, but the news of his return will certainly raise the spirit of our White Guard. Nikolai recognizes his renunciation as a mistake, because the slightest manifestation of weakness has brought the country to a long-term crisis. Now we need to decide whether Nicholas II is ready to take the reins of ruling by Great Russia in such a difficult time?"
 SOV.tsar.3.a:0 "Nikolai is weak, he will not hold power again."

 SOV.tsar.4.d:0 "All this time the White movement fought for the honor of our Tsar. Yes, we had serious disagreements and not all agree on the restoration of the monarchy in Russia, but it was only through our efforts that we managed to take Nicholas II out of captivity. Now we need to decide whether to be Russia under the auspices of the Romanovs' house, or to continue to create a new government under the leadership of Kolchak."
 
 SOV.tsar.5.t:0 "New Tsar"
 SOV.tsar.5.d:0 "All this time the White movement fought for the honor of our Tsar. Yes, we had serious disagreements and not all agree on the restoration of the monarchy in Russia, but still the Fatherland needs a legitimate leader. Among the representatives of the Romanovs' house, the closest heir is the cousin of the deceased Nikolai, Kirill Vladimirovich. However, only Alexander Kolchak  can say the decisive word to revive the Russian Empire, or to continue his dictatorship."

 SOV.parlament.1.d:0 "Elections to the Constituent Assembly showed that the Socialist Revolutionaries are particularly popular among the population, who occupied more than half of the seats, which by right of revolution should belong to us, the Bolsheviks! In addition, it turned out that the counter-revolutionary elements somehow got into the to the Assembly.

 SOV.dictatury.1.d:0 "We decided to disperse the Constituent Assembly. Elections will no longer be held.

 rusrevolt.11.t:0 "Soviet-Polish war!"
 rusrevolt.11.d:0 "This afternoon the Polish army launched an offensive against Soviet Belarus. The conflict began because of serious confrontations between Russia and Poland. On the demand for the establishment of the Soviet government, Poland began fighting to restore the borders of the lost Commonwealth. Although the fragile Polish army has few chances, the Soviet troops are in a difficult position because of the unstable situation in the country."

 rusrevolt.14.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly and the Soviets came to a decision on a new direction in the conduct of the Socialist Revolution. Leaving radical ideas and methods of the Bolsheviks, the country's socialists created a democratic government, which included a coalition of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. The revolution, as the leader of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Viktor Chernov, said, will continue until the victory over the White movement."
 rusrevolt.14.a:0 "Is this the end of the revolution?"
 
 
 rusrevolt.15.t:0 "Death Battalions"
 rusrevolt.15.d:0 "The army is weak, we can not deny it. The fighting spirit due to poor supply and terrible losses is getting lower, the troops are deserting and fraternizing with the enemy. The soldier needs an example of courage, a goal, for which he must fight, even if the war does not make more sense for him. We create the First Women's Death Team under the command of Maria Bochkareva, a true patriot and heroine of this war. If russian peasant is not able to stop the enemy, then russian woman can already tame enemies and beat out all fear from our soldiers."

 rusrevolt.16.d:0 "Moscow - the largest city of our vast homeland went over to the side of the Revolution. Of course, we can not but recognize Petrograd as an important city for every participant in this holy war with world imperialism, for this is the very heart of the Revolution, but nevertheless, for the further development of the offensive, we need to transfer our entire administration to the Kremlin in Moscow, so as not to be trapped, if the interventionists attempt to attack Petrograd near the border."

The last white generals run in panic. Those whom we could arrest will be brought before the Supreme Court. This Civil War had no equal in scale losses and the number of participants.

Lenin fled again, but now this feeble revolutionary can not escape prison abroad. Everyone who is involved in the accomplished offensive against Russia is awaiting the death penalty, no less! For all the destruction, for all suffering, the Reds will respond in full. And now we have to destroy the pro-Soviet insurgents in the territories of the former Empire and pray for the souls of the dead fighters in this bloody massacre for Russia."
 rusrevolt.18.a:0 "We will not forget our brothers!"
 rusrevolt.19.d:0 "The war between the revolutionary Red Army and the Whiteguard movement in Russia ended in an obvious defeat of the Whites. All this time this great country was fighting in convulsions and was bleeding no less than in the Great War with Germany. Now the Soviet country declared victory. The support of the Entente did not help the monarchists and other participants in the anti-revolutionary coalition, they did not restrain the onslaught of the Red Army and the terrible famine in the country and other weighty reasons that could break the spirit of any person. But as practice showed, faith in the victory of world socialism was stronger than fear of death. With the emergence of socialism in the world, a new page in the history of mankind will begin."
 rusrevolt.20.d:0 "The war between the revolutionary Red Army and the White Guard movement in Russia ended in the collapse of the communist uprising. Supporters of the monarchy in Russia, members of the anti-revolutionary coalition with the support of the Entente, achieved success in the struggle against socialism. But now the country lies in the wreckage of the collapsed empire and will not recover soon. The civilian brother-murderous war had no borders and touched many countries around the world. However, we should not say that the defeat of socialism in the world is the final point of this movement. After the fall of Soviet Moscow and Petrograd, thousands of revolutionaries fled abroad to sow the grain of socialism in order to fight the world evil of capitalism."

 rusrevolt.ussr.11.t:0 "City of Stalin"
 rusrevolt.ussr.11.d:0 "Our great Leader Stalin was a participant in the Civil War and fought fierce battles on the Kuban front with the White Army of the Don Army. Thanks to his zeal, control over the city of Tsaritsyn was restored, but, as you can guess, we can not tolerate the survivals of tsarism in the Soviet country. The Council supported the initiative to rename Tsaritsyn to Stalingrad in honor of the merit of our leader in the struggle for the formation of the Soviet Union."
 rusrevolt.ussr.11.a:0 "Long live Comrade Stalin!"
 
 rusrevolt.ussr.12.t:0 "City of Trotsky"
 rusrevolt.ussr.12.d:0 "Thanks to Comrade Leon Trotsky, we united the country in the struggle against the tsarists and crushed them on all fronts. The war was long over, but the relics of the Empire remained in the names of many cities, and one of them was Tsaritsyn. We can not leave such a name - this is blasphemy! From this moment we rename Tsaritsyn to the city of Leon Trotsky - Leongrad! Without his genius, the revolution would never have happened!"
 rusrevolt.ussr.12.a:0 "Only Trotsky will be able to crush the counter!"
 
 rusrevolt.intervention.1.t:0 "Intervention Entente"
 rusrevolt.intervention.1.d:0 "We underestimated the threat of revolution and plunged the country into the Civil War by inaction during the war with Germany. But our former enemies capitulated, and former allies do not recognize our cause. The only way out to avoid failure in the Civil War is to ask the Entente for help."
 rusrevolt.intervention.1.a:0 "We are allies. I hope so."
 
 rusrevolt.intervention.2.t:0 "Intervention in Russia"
 rusrevolt.intervention.2.d:0 "The movement of the White Guard, which conducts the Civil War with the revolutionaries for the restoration of monarchical rule, requests immediate assistance. If we agree to support, this will only mean one thing: we will declare war on the Socialist Revolution and invade Russia. After all that we experienced in the Great War, do we need it?"
 rusrevolt.intervention.2.a:0 "First Russia, and then the whole world. We must stop them!"
 rusrevolt.intervention.2.b:0 "No thanks. It's cold there."
 
 rusrevolt.intervention.3.t:0 "Support for intervention"
 rusrevolt.intervention.3.d:0 "The volunteer corps of the interventionists is already preparing to join us. Their support will not be superfluous."
 rusrevolt.intervention.3.a:0 "Thank God."
 
 rusrevolt.intervention.4.t:0 "Rejection of intervention"
 rusrevolt.intervention.4.d:0 "Not all countries decided to support us in the struggle against the revolutionaries. It will be worse for them if we do not restrain the revolution here and now."
 rusrevolt.intervention.4.a:0 "Damn it!"
 
 rusrevolt.fin.1.t:0 "Finnish question"
 rusrevolt.fin.1.d:0 "The civil war is blazing in all the territories of the former empire, and it would be at least shameful not to support our comrades in the struggle for justice. Now the most tense point of this war is in Finland and even minimal pressure on the Finnish Senate can cause large-scale military operations in the country. On the other hand, the Senate is a gang of bureaucrats on a leash from Germany. If we hold the Finnish Council, the Germans will immediately react and our comrades will not have a chance to win."
 rusrevolt.fin.1.a:0 "Hopelessly. We recognize the Senate."
 rusrevolt.fin.1.b:0 "Long live Red Finland!"
 
 rusrevolt.fin.2.t:0 "Civil War in Finland"
 rusrevolt.fin.2.d:0 "The situation has heated up to the limit. With the support of the Soviet government of Russia, the rebels raised an uprising. General Karl Mannerheim took responsibility for the suppression of the uprising. The Finnish Council of People's Commissioners is unlikely to make concessions, and therefore this Civil War will drag on for a long time."
 rusrevolt.fin.2.a:0 "We will crush the Reds!"
 rusrevolt.fin.2.b:0 "Forward, Red Suomi!"
 
 rusrevolt.fin.2.t:0 "Civil War in Finland"
 rusrevolt.fin.2.d:0 "Finland was engulfed by the Civil War between the government of the Senate and the insurgent Council of People's Commissioners of Finland. Having obtained its independence and sovereignty during the Brest Peace, Finland enlisted the support of Germany, but the consequences of the revolution did not bypass the already shaky position of the nation. Although the white Finns did not occupy the most advantageous position, having lost the production region in the south, the Red Suomi could not long without the support of Soviet Russia and the sympathizing revolution."
 rusrevolt.fin.2.a:0 "How long will this confrontation last?"
